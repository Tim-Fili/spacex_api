# Spacex_API

## Program purpose
This program's purpose was for to work with a small web-based API aligned with my personal interests. SpaceX has an open API data for "All Launches" anyone can work with. I wanted to test my ability to convert a web-based API to a readble .csv file. Then work with the .csv file through matplotlib. I wanted to also connect this project to my Tableau public page to cross the information from one platform to another and work on data visualization.

### Three Features
This Project has three feature incorporated to it.
1. Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app.
2. Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
3. Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data.

### Running the program:
*Make sure you have installed the latest version of Python, ```python 3.7``` or newer*

#### 1. Install Necessary Libraries and modules:
* Jupyter Notebook: ``` pip install notebook```
* Requests:  ```pip install requests```
* Pandas:  ```pip install pandas```
* matplotlib:  ```pip install matplotlib```

#### 2. Clone Repo to local machine

#### 3. Terminal/Command Line: 
* Navigate to root folder
* Run ```jupyter notebook```

#### 4. In Jupyter Notebook: 
* Find ``spacex_api.ipynb``
* Open ``spacex_api.ipynb``
* "RUN" each code cell
* "Run" Last code cell *(will open a new web browser with a Tableau dashboard)*

#### 5. Tableau Public Dashboard:
* Explore the data visualizations
